Tan present work of Q. Curtius Rufus has come down to us in·
complete—the first two books, and some portione in the middle
and near the end, being wanting in all the manuscripts. It would
seem that the ancient copyist, who considered the first two books,
containing the life and exploits os Alexander mainly aster lris
entering Asia, to be less necessary or interesting, commended
transcrihing at the third book, when Alexander having gained
the victory on the Granicus, had already obtained a firm footing
in Asia, and was entering upon his successful career, conquering
countries which had never before been the scene os Greek mili·
tary enterprise. The other gaps in the work have been filled up
in modern editions, as in the present, by the supplements of the
learned Freinsheim3 so that the history oi Alexander is con·
tinued uninterruptedly down to the point to which Curtius in·
tended to carry it-namely, to the establishment of a 'regency
aller the death os the conqueror. The ieet that the same gaps
occur in all manuscripts, justifies the inserente, that the manu·
scripta known to exist, and the number of which is eighteen,
are derived from one and the same, which has thus become the
mother-codex sor all the others. The copies, however, present
, great differences in detail, sor towards the end of the middle
ages, the textos Curtius was subjected to a thorongh revision by
a scholar who was very clever, but at the same time oilen too
bold, and stom this revised copy others again were made, p'artly
with new emendations, and partly with unintentional mistakes.
ln this manner we may distinguish three classes of manuscripts
-namely, 1. Ancient and faithful copies, without intentional cor·
rectione, but sometimes unintelligible, because the original manu·
script itsels was in' some parts faulty or illegibls3 2. Manuscripts
which betray the eorrecting hand os the above-mentioned scholar,
but are otherwise written with tolerabis accuracy; 3. Manuscripts
which are based upon the revised copy, but ars disflgured by
numerous mistskes, arising partly from arbitrary emendations,
and partly from carelessness. '
