dre close 01 1110 1111000111 century (the first is that 01 Venice 1
1471), are based upon manuscripts 01 the third class, because
they were 01 10010 100001 origin, and consequently more legible.
The saults which were thus introduced throughout the text,
though they* consisted only in single words and their arrange-
1000111ον0 remained unexpunged until the most recent times,
although the desecta did not escape the notic'e 01 learned edi·
tors; and many parts 01 1110 text were corrected, sometimes
by conjectures, but more frequently from better manuscripts,
hythe scholars 01 1110 sixteenth century, as by Franciscus
Asulanus (in the edition 01 Aldus, 1525), Hadrianus Junius
(11401011111000110111101010110). Τ11011 emendations, how·
ever, met with· little confidence, because the reasons and sources
01 111011 corrections were but rarely and incompletely stated.
Hence other editors, end among them especially Freinsheim
= ,(16400011 1670), who has otherwise great merite, preferred re·
taining theold and faulty text, and altering it only in such pas·
seges where it seemed indispensably necessary. Owing to a
feeling 01 reverende 101 Freinsheim, the 1011 as constituted by
him remained unchanged in the large edition 01 Snalrenburg
(Delli and heyden, 1724); and on the whole, in all the subse-
quent editions also, although the iaulty nature 01 1110 vulgate
became more and more obvious by comparing several ancient
, 0011 good manuscripts. Schmieder (Gottingen, 1803) was 1110
11101 who restored a much' more correct tert, though he did not

The present editor first published 00 edition 01 Curtius (Berlin,
1826),10 which, with the assistance 01 more manuscripts than
arry 01 his predecessore had made use 01, he restored thebert,
as ser as possible, 01 the genuine and unedulterated manuscripts
01 the first class. In the commentary to his great edition (81000- ,
1010101849),οο has stated the reasons and sources 01 011 the
changes he has made in 1110 text, giving at the sometime a com-
plete account 01 the different readings 01 both the manuscripts
aud the early editions. The critical reader is thercby enabled
10 recognise the condition 01 1110 text, and, it is hoped, 10 con·
vince himself 01 the correctness os the course which the editor
has adopted.

The text here presented is the same as 11111101 the last-men·
tioned edition, to which, sor all critical questions, the render
is 10101101. The notes accompanying the present edition do
nct enter into critical discussions, their object being the expla-
nation 01 the text; and combined with the ample 00010010 pre·
fixed to each book, they sumish ererything ,which appeared
necessary to lead a studione youth 10 a correct understanding
