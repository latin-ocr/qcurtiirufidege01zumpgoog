we are justified in connecting the best period of our author with
the yesr in which his predecessor iu the list died. Itis possible,¹
indeed, thet the consular, whose reel origin Tacitus conceels from
e feeling of modesty, was en illegitimate son of the rhetoricienss
Ἴ These scholare who suppose the author 01 the lile 01 Alexander

to be either the rhetoricien mentioned by Suetonius, or the con-
suler described by Tacitus-as well as those who consider the
eulogy on the Romen princeps, x. 28, to refer to Augustus, or
Claudius, or Vespasiae, or even, which is still less possible, to
Trajan-egres with us iu the opinion thet the Latin lenguege in
the worlr of Curtius is worthy of all praise. We ourselves
recognise in it the perfection 01 Romen literature, on account of
the perfect eccuracy in the appropriate use of‘separete words,
end in the syntecticel combination 01 words into clauses aud
sentences. There is only one point in which a slight deviation
from the clessicel prose of Cicero end Cresar may be observed;
namely, thet sometimes the expressions which were formerly
used only in poetry are here introduced into prose-such es
0001011 101 citu or aetus, souma for jaceretur, 101010 101 nedelis,
1101001110 ,· the frequent end thereby weelrened use of ingess, and
of litteren for relinquere· also the joining pessire verbs with
the detive insteed 01 using the proposition ab. The frequent use
of teroem 101 ssd, in which, however, Sallust hed preceded Cur·
tius, ie lihewise a slight deviaticu from the eerlier lenguage.
Other deviatione, such es the ¹absolute nse 01 the participle per·
fect passive- for instance, nunilo lor perun aedilem estu, with s
sentence following5 the use of the participle future ecrite in con·
nection with a hypotheticsl sentence-for instance, viii. 11, oti·
noum dtinuit ponerem uectem, ent prohibitus aret, should be
considered rather as exemplet 01 e judicious development 01
the language then ss defects, since brevity and precision of ex·
pressicn ere thereby promoted. The speeches, in particular,
which Curtius, egreeebly to the custom of the ancients and the
example 01011101 historiens, interweaves into his history, are
distinguished 101 their energetic eloquence, end for the appropri-
ateuess in the charecters 01 the speakers, from which circum-
stance we may infer the rhetorical acriviry 01 the author, end
his intention to produce a work with specimens of his slrill He
had in this respect, end indeed in the whole composition 01
his history, s model in the Greek worlr of Clitarchus, e cele·
breied historico, who lived soon efter the doeth 01 Alexander,
and was much praised hythe encients for his rhetorical powers,
though he wes suspected 01 credulity, especially in his descrip-
tion of the wonders 01 far distent countries. The seme delecte,
accordingly, are found in our Latin 00111011 but it muttire
