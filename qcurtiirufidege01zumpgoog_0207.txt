¹ Accordin to our anthor’s notione, this would be the Cimmerion
Bosporus, w ich connects the Pontus Euxinus with the Palus
Maeotis. But we are now much further east, on the shores of tha
Caspiau. If Alexander's amhassador was ordered to visit an in-
land sea in that neighbourhood, which had some resemblance to the
Palus Maeotis, it might be the lake of Aral, into which the iaxartes
flows; but he certainly did not penetrate so far. The ancients, at
least their writers, had no idea cf the true geogra hical connection
of these vast ste pes. The merchants, however, who traded thither,
and probably Alexander himself, rhnst have possessed a much more
accurato knowledge of the country.
